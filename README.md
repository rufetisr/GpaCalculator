I updated my 2 year-old Gpa calculator website, adding some backend logic and updated the front. 

It lets you calculate your GPA based on points and credits, and you can even save your grades to revise them later. 

On the frontend, I used libraries like Bootstrap, React Router, Formik and Yup, Toastify. 

To ensure that whether user's email exists really or not while registering I sent a verification link to user email and user can login only after verify the email.

I also added language feature, you can now switch between English, Russian, and Azerbaijani.

On the backend, I worked with Express, Mongoose, JWT for authentication, Joi for validation, Nodemailer for emails, and Winston for logging actions, and also api request limit to make the backend a little secure.
